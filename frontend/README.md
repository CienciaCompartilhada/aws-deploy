# CC_frontend
This is the frontend implementation of our web Application CiÃªncia Compartilhada

## Introduction
The purpose of this application is to connect teachers and students in the field of scientific research. 
It allows users to make requests to the database and retrieve lists of users, teachers, and projects 
based on a matching algorithm that considers their respective areas of interest. Both teachers and students 
can have preferences for up to 5 areas of expertise. Each project must be associated with a specific area of expertise.
